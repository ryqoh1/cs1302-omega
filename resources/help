Game Rules:

The objective of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids. 
The player controls a ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward.
Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for unlimited time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction.  

Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. 
Objects wrap around screen edges â€“ for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction.
As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points.

A round ends when all asteroids are destroyed.
After the end of each round, the player receives an extra life, or bonus points if the player already has the maximum number of lives(5).
